            <p>To Mireia</p>
            <p>I wanted you to wake up today with a smile,
because today is special —
it’s been one month since we officially became “us.”
And even though I can’t be there to kiss you good morning,
I hope these words feel like a warm hug from me to you.

The truth is, my love for you began long before that day.
From the very first time I saw your smile,
I knew something in me had changed.

Your beauty leaves me speechless…
You have eyes that shine like honey in the sunlight,
lips that always feel like a promise,
and skin as soft as your voice when you speak gently.
Your long, dark hair falls like a hypnotic waterfall,
and your smile… that smile is my favorite place in the world.

But what I love most about you
is what can’t be seen.
You’re patient, understanding, affectionate,
with a brilliant mind that inspires me every day.
You’re funny, sweet, thoughtful…
You’re everything I didn’t even know I was looking for.

Distance keeps me from holding you today,
but my love doesn’t care about distance.
Because I carry you in every thought,
every breath,
every “I miss you.”

One month with you,
and I already can’t imagine life without you.
Thank you for being exactly who you are.
Thank you for making me so happy.

I hope your morning is as beautiful as your heart.
I love you — happy one month, mi amor.
